# stripe-demo

This project demonstrates usage of Stripe Charge API and PaymentIntent API to complete a sample payment.

While using PaymentIntent Demo, use test card nubmer 4000 0027 6000 3184 to enforce authenticating with 3D Secure else use
4242 4242 4242 4242 which skips additional authentication in the workflow.
